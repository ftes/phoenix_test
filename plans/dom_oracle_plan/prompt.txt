I'm considering an architectural change or rebuild.
I want to use flexible selectors (similar to what Plyawright offers). See ../ptp (PhoenxiTestPlaywright).
Also, I want to better ensure we are aligned with DOM spec for HTML (and HTTP?).

It feels like PhoenixTest encapsulates a lot of DOM spec knowledge, without making it explicit (especially simulating how forms behave).

Check the code base, check what playwright (especially vanilla JS client) does.
Cross-check my opinion.

Make suggestions.
Can we use a 'DOM simulation' to improve the implementation?
Automated tests for DOM spec adherence?
Correlate with browser implementation or browser based tests as ultimate source of truth?
